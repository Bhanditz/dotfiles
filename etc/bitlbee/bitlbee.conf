## RunMode:
##
##  Inetd -- Run from inetd (default)
##  Daemon -- Run as a stand-alone daemon, serving all users from one process.
##    This saves memory if there are more users, the downside is that when one
##    user hits a crash-bug, all other users will also lose their connection.
##  ForkDaemon -- Run as a stand-alone daemon, but keep all clients in separate
##    child processes. This should be pretty safe and reliable to use instead
##    of inetd mode.
