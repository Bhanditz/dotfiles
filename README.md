My dotfiles, My Own Linux System

These are the dotfiles I'm currently using for my system. not perfect yet and
have a lot of unneeded or missing configurations

Install
========

These dotfiles files are for my personal needs and don't sweet your needs and
system. These dotfiles depend on some other dotfiles and applications to work
correctly or they may make your system unstable.

* fork the repository and tweak the dotfiles to sweet your needs and you current
system configurations
* Create a link of every dotfile you need from ~ folder to your home directory
* Copy dotfiles you want from etc files to /etc (DON'T CREATE LINKS)
* Some dotfiles are missing as they contain some personal informations or some
  secure data, create your own dotfiles
* Some dotfiles needs some extra apps/daemons to be installed

NOTE: I have added dotfiles.sh script to made it easier to sync and check
status of dotfiles. tweak config files dotfile-{home,etc}.list to matches your
needs before using the script
